# Sentiment Analysis of UC Davis Professor Reviews
[Project Report](https://github.com/Riley-Adams/sta141b_project/blob/main/sta141B_final_report.pdf)

[Project Repository](https://github.com/Riley-Adams/sta141b_project)

In this project, which was a final project for a course called STA 141B: Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis at UC Davis, we used Python to conduct a sentiment analysis of reviews from RateMyProfessors.com. To obtain the data necessary for this project we scraped all professor names from the UC Davis RateMyProfessors page and then scraped data from all subsequent professors' pages. We conducted exploratory analysis, cleaned the data, then implemented natural language processing techniques to process review text. Then we built a logistic regression model to perform sentiment classification and assessed our results.

# Curve Fitting for Life Expectancy Data

[Project Repository]

In this project, which was a final project for a course called MAT 167: Applied Linear Algebra, we used MATLAB to implement various algorithms which fit a curve to best describe the relationship between a country's average life expectancy and the average years of schooling for citizen's of that country. We compared the fit of linear, quadratic, cubic, and logarithmic curves using the 2-norm of the residuals vector. Curves were fit to the data by solving the least squares problem using the psuedoinverse, 3 different algorithms for QR decomposition (Classical Gram-Shmidt, Modified Gram-Schmidt, Householder Triangularization) and Singular Value Decomposition.
