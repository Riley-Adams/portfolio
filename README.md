# [Sentiment Analysis of UC Davis Professor Reviews]
[Project Repository](https://github.com/Riley-Adams/sta141b_project)
In this project, which was a final project for a course called STA 141B: Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis at UC Davis, we conducted a sentiment analysis of reviews from RateMyProfessors.com. To obtain the data necessary for this project we scraped all professor names from the UC Davis RateMyProfessors page and then scraped data from all subsequent professors' pages. We conducted exploratory analysis, cleaned the data, then implemented natural language processing techniques to process review text. Then we built a logistic regression model to perform sentiment classification and assessed our results.
